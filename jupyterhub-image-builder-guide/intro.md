# Yuvi's Guide to Building JupyterHub images

Welcome to my first ever 'book' of any sort :) This is an attempt to extract knowledge that
seems to be stuck in my head on building Docker images of various sorts for use with JupyterHubs.
These are somewhat opinionated, but have worked well across various communities & institutions for
many years now. Even if you do not want to adopt any of it wholesale, I hope there are enough 
parts you can pick and choose to use from here.

While the focus of this book is on building images for use with JupyterHub, everything here applies
100% to building images that work on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) or any other BinderHubs.
